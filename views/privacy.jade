    p It's quite simple. DuckDuckBing doesn't track any queries submitted whatsoever, It simply redirects you to DuckDuckGo or Bing depending on whether your search contains a !bang or not. 
    p The source code for this is available 
      a(href='https://github.com/timescam/duckduckbing/blob/master/app.js#L22') here on GitHub
      |  so you're free to take a look or even host your own version if you'd like.
